# Add directories or file patterns to ignore during indexing (e.g. foo/ or *.csv)

# Override .gitignore to include dependencies for better IntelliSense
# The ! prefix means "don't ignore this" (include it in indexing)
# !_build/
# !_build/default/
# !_build/default/lib/

# However, we still want to exclude some parts of _build for performance
_build/test/
_build/prod/
_build/*/lib/*/doc/
_build/*/lib/*/test/
_build/*/lib/*/.git/

# Large text files that don't need indexing
RevisionBig*.txt

# Crash dumps and logs
*.dump
erl_crash.dump

# OS specific files
.DS_Store

# IDE specific directories (optional - you might want these for some projects)
.idea/
.vscode/

# Git directory (usually not needed for code completion)
.git/

# Binary and compiled artifacts (but we want to keep _build/default/lib for dependencies)
# Exclude only the beam files and other binaries within dependencies
**/*.beam
**/*.so
**/*.dll
**/*.dylib

# Keep the main dependency source code for indexing
# This means _build/default/lib/ will be indexed for better IntelliSense

# Alternative approach: If you want to include only specific dependencies, uncomment the following
# and comment out the lines above. This excludes all dependencies except the ones you specify:

# _build/default/lib/
!_build/default/lib/woody/
!_build/default/lib/damsel/
# !_build/default/lib/epgsql/
# !_build/default/lib/cowboy/
# !_build/default/lib/thrift/
# !_build/default/lib/jsx/
# !_build/default/lib/jsone/

!.env
